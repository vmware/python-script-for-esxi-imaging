## Introduction

The Python Script for ESXi Imaging creates an ESXi ISO image with an installation script (kickstart file) from the base ISO image to automate ESXi installation and configuration for VMware vSphere Foundation (VVF) and VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF).

The Python script uses the `re-image-hosts.json` and `firstboot-scripts.txt` files to generate the required installation script.

## Requirements

### System Requirements

To install ESXi, your system must meet specific requirements. Refer the [ESXi Requirements][docs-esxi-requirements] for more details.

### ESXi

- ESXi 7.0 or later.
- The ESXi installer ISO image `VMware-VMvisor-Installer-x.x.x-XXXXXX.x86_64.iso`, where `x.x.x` is the version of ESXi you are installing, and `XXXXXX` is the build number of the installer ISO image.

### Operating System

- [VMware Photon OS][info-photon] 4.0 Rev2

  - You can use the [Photon OS sample appliance][download-sample-appliance] or use the code from the [GitHub project][gh-sample-appliance] to build the appliance.
  - The sample appliance includes all required packages, otherwise, you must install the following packages:

    ```console
    tdnf install -y \
      git \
      python3-pip \
      cdrkit
    ```

  - Ensure you have enough space to generate the ISO files.

### Python

- [Python 3.10][info-python], included by default on Photon OS 4.0 Rev2.

- The sample appliance includes all required Python packages, otherwise you must install the following packages:

  ```console
  pip install maskpass==0.3.1
  pip install psutil
  ```

## Generating the ESXi ISO Image

1. Use a Secure Shell (SSH) client to log in as the `root` user to the photon appliance at `<host_virtual_machine_fqdn>:22`.
2. Clone the repository into a directory.

   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/vmware/python-script-for-esxi-imaging.git
   cd esxi-imaging
   ```

3. Download the ESXi installer (ISO file) from your OEM or the [Broadcom Support Portal][kb-broadcom-downloads] and place the ISO file in the `esxi-imaging` directory.
4. Modify the [`re-image-hosts.json`][sample-json] file to update details like the ISO file name, MD5 checksum, network configuration, and installation disk.

5. If required, update the `firstboot-scripts.txt` file. Add the post-install commands that need to be run once the installation is completed. By default, SSH and ESXi shell are enabled. Additionally, the self-signed certificate on all ESXi hosts will be regenerated.
6. Run the following command to generate the ISO file.

   ```console
   python create-custom-iso.py -j re-image-hosts.json
   ```

   If you are using the [Photon OS sample appliance][download-sample-appliance] and logged in as the `admin` user, run the command with sudo.

   ```console
   sudo python create-custom-iso.py -j re-image-hosts.json
   ```

7. Enter and confirm the password for the ESXi root account.

The script generates an ISO file with a timestamp that includes the kickstart file after successful validation. If the optional parameter `-s` or `--suffix` is specified in the command line, the given value will be appended to the output ISO file instead of the timestamp.

You can use this ISO installer image for regular boot or UEFI boot.

You can use the [remote management applications][docs-esxi-install-remote-management-applications] to install ESXi hosts remotely.

## Troubleshooting

- If the specified MAC address in JSON does not match with the host then the installation wizard would throw an error:

  ```console
  An error has occurred while parsing the installation script. Could not open the file. no such file or directory.
  ```

  Ensure that proper MAC address is specified.

- If you encounter an error like:

  ```console
  mkisofs: command not found
  ERROR Create an ISO with the updated KS file command did not run successfully. Exiting...
  ```

  Ensure that `mkisofs` is available. If not, install the `cdrkit` package and try again.

- After the installation is complete, if the firstboot scripts are not run, please refer to `/var/log/kickstart.log`.
- To view the kickstart file's content in the generated ISO file, run the following command

  ```console
  python display-ks-content.py -i <your_generated_iso_file>
  ```

## Limitations

- Does not support upgrades; only the installation scenario is supported.

## Known Issues

- If secure boot is enabled, the commands in the `firstboot-scripts.txt` file will not be executed.
